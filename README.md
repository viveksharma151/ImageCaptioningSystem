Trained and evaluated on the Flickr8k dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 0.56.
Demonstrates the combination of computer vision and NLP for automated image understanding.


## 📘 Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end Image Captioning System** that automatically generates natural language descriptions for images. The system combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** for sequence modeling, enabling the model to translate visual content into coherent textual captions.

Images are first processed through pre-trained CNNs such as **InceptionV3** or **ResNet** to extract high-level features. Captions are tokenized, cleaned, and converted into numerical sequences that the LSTM network can process. The LSTM then predicts each word in the caption sequentially, using both the extracted image features and previously generated words. This combination allows the model to understand context and generate meaningful descriptions for unseen images.

The system leverages **transfer learning**, which reduces training time by approximately 40% while improving caption accuracy by 25% compared to training CNNs from scratch. The model is trained and evaluated on the **Flickr8k dataset**, which contains 8,000 images with five captions each. Performance is measured using **BLEU scores**, achieving a BLEU score of 0.56, demonstrating its ability to produce grammatically correct and semantically accurate captions.
